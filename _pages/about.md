Artificial Brilliance is a place to explore the possibilities of artificial intelligence with the
goal of sharing what I have learned with others as well as learn from others.

My name is Dominic Kramer.  I have a background in mathematics and computer science both from an academic and industry perspective, have a PhD in mathematics, have taught many undergraduate courses, have worked in various companies such as Google, Databricks, and Boeing, and am excited to continually grow and learn.

I have been following the advances in artificial intelligence for some time and have had the fortune to work with Christian Szegedy, Esteban Real, and many others on exciting artificial intelligence related topics.

From this, I find the current advances in large language models to be very exciting, but feel they are just the tip of the iceberg with respect to what is to come.  I enjoy learning about, exploring, and writing about artificial intelligence, and I hope you find this blog helpful.

The companion GitHub organization for this blog is called [artifical-brilliance](https://github.com/artificial-brilliance) and contains the accompanying code described in the blog.  Note that the organization's code is designed to be illustrative in nature rather than being being production ready.  As such, some common practices might not be followed if doing so makes the code easier to follow and learn from.

Besides artificial intelligence, I am also deeply interested in the foundations of mathematics, type theory, and how to improve the way mathematics is recorded and communicated.  In this regard, I have created [Mathlingua](https://mathlingua.org/), a language for precisely and structurally describing mathematical axioms, conjectures, theorems, and definitions and [Mathlore](https://mathlore.org), an archive of mathematical knowledge encoded in Mathlingua.
